# System Design and Justification for NJ Transit and Provider Directory Software

## Authors: Allen Mena, Arianna Azizi, Samuel Habib, James Lee 

### Abstract

    In New Jersey (and the greater United States), the issue of accessible healthcare provider data that is relevant to patients in these care systems is prevalent, and requires a solution that users can always access in order to obtain information pertinent to receiving care in their area. This currently does not exist on a state or national level, and the provider data currently available on the internet is unstructured at best, and at-worst, unavailable without deep searching into provider coalitions and other organizations that try to represent what data they can find into their own directories. However, because this data exists in smaller directories, the goal is to add additional pertinent information that can be accessed by calculations made up of a combination of provider data, and NJ transit route information. This combination of data can lead to new insights as to which patients have the most difficult time getting to providers, and a calculated justification as to why. 
    
    For this application, Python, JavaScript, MongoDB, React, and AWS were all utilized to create a live platform that will be deployed locally using AWS as the event handler for user address submissions to find which providers are closest to them and how difficult it is to get to said providers. Through this process, calculations were able to be made for the closest provider, the closest bus stop to get to the provider, walkability index, and travel difficulty index, and this information was given to the user.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
